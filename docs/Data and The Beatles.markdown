When I was 15 years old, I stumbled upon the catalogue of a mildly famous british invasion band of the 1960s. I am of course talking about The Beatles. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr took the world in a swift, yet decisive swoop. And in the summer of 2006, they took me as well.
My journey in life and in music has since moved on by many steps, and yet my love for the music of The Beatles never cedes. There is something to their music that just - sticks. And as I enjoy combining my hobbies, I was looking into what fun project I could dive into that would combine my passion for data science with my love for music. In this case, my love for The Beatles.

For some reason, I found myself reminded the other day of the odd <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_is_dead">conspiracy theory</a> that, allegedly, Paul McCartney died in a car crash in November 1966 before the recordings for Sgt. Pepper's and was then replaced by a double. People believed they'd see signs for that everywhere, like the Abbey Road album cover where Macca is seen barefoot (or so people thought) and a car has a cryptic license plate.
Sir Paul McCartney is, of course, alive and well, and I sincerely wish him the best for many more years to come. If you haven't listened, his latest work is even fairly good, I heartily recommend it. But given my scientific and inquisitive mindset, I wondered: was there a way to tackle this question empirically, from the data-driven perspective? How could we deal with this?

I quickly went on to formulate a hypothesis. Suppose we were able to capture, in some ways, some characteristics of Beatles-songs. Knowing which songs McCartney (mainly) composed (despite the Lennon&McCartney-credit, it is usually possible to tell), we can see if we can identify a songwriting-pattern that is unique to Paul McCartney. We could then compare his songwriting before and after his alleged death and see if we could spot a difference.
Before I even knew it, I was already knee-deep in coding (and debugging...). I used the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/charlie86/spotifyr">SpotifyR</a> library for R and accessed song-data for The Beatles that I then somewhat cleaned and loaded into Python. The whole analysis is of course also doable in R, but I favored Python for this project. There are also API-Wrapper for Spotify for Python, such as the <a href="https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1/">spotipy</a> package, but I found it somewhat worse to handle than SpotifyR. Either way, I uploaded the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maggomor/Has-Paul-McCartney-died/main/beatles.csv">dataset on Beatles songs</a> on my <a href="https://github.com/maggomor/Has-Paul-McCartney-died">Github Repository for this project</a>, where you will also find a <a href="https://github.com/maggomor/Has-Paul-McCartney-died/blob/main/McCartney_Analyse.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook I did with Google Colab</a> with which you can code along and follow my steps. Here, I mainly wish to outline the basics of my findings.

After retrieving and cleaning the data, I first obtained a few plots to get a feeling how Beatles-songs can be characterized. As an example, I have here plotted the attribute "Dancyness" which captures how dancy a song is. I have grouped this data by album and plotted a so-called Ridge-Plot or "Joyplot" (named in honour of the first album "Unknown Pleasures" of british post-punk Band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Division">Joy Division</a>. Here you can see the densities:

Neat, right? You can create similar graphs for different measures as well, but that is for another time. For now, I wanted to find out if we could see a difference in the songwriting of Sir Paul McCartney and the rest of the Beatles. I chose some suited measures, namely "Danceability", "Valence" (the joyfulness of a song), and "Liveness", "Acousticness", and "Instrumentalness", which seem to be fairly self-explanatory. Here we see their density plotted once for songs by other Beatles (in blue) and once for McCartney (in orange):

There does seem to be some difference, right? Paul seems to be somewhat more dancy, less joyful (how that goes together, I do not know), and overall more instrumental (sure passes the sniff check as McCartney was the most musical of the Fab Four). The previous graph was for the entire discography, but what can we say about this before and after the alleged death of Paul McCartney? Here is a graph that only captures the early Beatles periods (before Sgt. Petter) in which nobody disputes that Paul McCartney was alive (yet some dispute that any of the four actually wrote any song and instead claim that it was instead <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2019/sep/10/a-little-help-from-my-neo-marxist-philosopher-adorno-fifth-beatle-according-olavo-carvalho">None Other than Theodor W. Adorno</a> who wrote all the Beatles' music):

Again: we do see some differences in songwriting! They seem to have become more broad e.g. in terms of instrumentality, joyfulness, etc. This comes hardly as a surprise: nobody who first listens to Please Please Me and then to Abbey Road would claim that The Beatles had not changed in that period. After all, the 1960s were a very inventive period: not just The Beatles, also people like Bob Dylan or the fabulous The Beach Boys changed their style, somewhat quite drastically. So let's see if we can find similar patterns both for songs written by other Beatles and by McCartney. Here is a similar pre- / post-death comparison for the other Beatles:

<img href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maggomor/maggomor.github.io/gh-pages/docs/assets/images/Rest%20Comparison%20pre%20and%20post-supposed-Death.png">

And here is the same comparison only for Sir Paul McCartney:

<img href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maggomor/maggomor.github.io/gh-pages/docs/assets/images/Macca%20Comparison%20pre%20and%20post-supposed-Death.png">

What do we see here? Both Paul McCartney and the other Beatles seem to have changed their songwriting styles. But have they changed in *different ways*?
Let me remind you of the research question of this absolutely serious endeavour: does Beatles' songwriting data give us any clue as to whether the Paul-is-Dead-Hypothesis is actually true? My research hypothesis hence became the following: if Sir Paul McCartney had died on November 9th, 1966, then whoever would come to impose him would not have been able to copy his unique songwriting style. Had Paul not died, so I theorize, his songwriting style probably would have changed - but in a pattern similar to that of other Beatles songwriters. If Pauls style changed in a *significantly different manner* before and after the alleged death, then that might be a clue as to whether this hypothesis is true. Put differently: if the Paul-is-dead-Hypothesis is correct, then we should see Paul's songwriting evolve differently in the data. 

Once we have formulated it in this manner, it also becomes obvious, which statistical technique is recommendable here: a *Difference-in-Differences*-framework. Statistically, this can be implemented by an Ordinary Least-Squares Regression of the desired characteristic (e.g. "Dancyness", "Instrumentalness", etc.) on a) a "Written-by-Paul-McCartney"-0/1-Dummy, b) a "Pre-/Post-Death"-0/1-Dummy, and c) their interaction term, i.e. the product of a) and b). This latter interaction term captures the Diff-in-Diff (DiD) effect, and this one is what we are after. If this coefficient is significantly different from 0, then that is an indication that Paul evolved differently here from the other Beatles. So, I ran the regressions with the dependent variables "mode" (Major or Minor Key), "dancyness", "valence", "liveness", "speechiness", "acousticness", and "instrumentalness". I then obtained the DiD-coefficients along with confidence bands and plotted them. This is the baseline result:

<img href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maggomor/maggomor.github.io/gh-pages/docs/assets/images/OLS_Coefficients.png">

Except for the coefficient on "Mode" (which has a huge confidence band, nevertheless), nothing here is significant. The mode-Coefficient can be interpreted in terms of a marginal probability difference: compared to the rest of the Beatles, the likelihood difference for writing a song in the key of major between Paul McCartney and the rest of the Beatles increased by 29%-points (!). This is a lot - but seeing as post-1966 Lennon really got into being mopey and addicted to heroin, and George always was rather melancholic, it comes no surprise that jolly old Grampa "When I'm 64" McCartney was the dominant major-key-writer in the group afterwards. 
Still, note how none of the other coefficients are significant! Nothing aside from the mode-variable is significantly differently altered by the DiD-coefficient. In other words, this simple framework does not give us any cause to believe that the Paul-is-Dead-hypothesis is true: Paul did not evolve differently in his songwriting characteristics than the other Beatles. 

This DiD-framework is very powerful: we even control away any heterogeneity across albums by introducing the Pre-/Post-Dummy. To show that, there is also a Fixed-Effect-implementation in the Jupyter-Notebook, showing that the results are identical to the simple OLS DiD! But there is one final thing we did not control for: heteroskedasticity! Our statistical inference (significance) is based on the assumption of a homoscedastic error term. Given the nature of our variables and our setting, this cannot be plausible. Luckily, there are ways of combatting this, so we can make use of heteroskedastic error terms. Does anything change? Not really. The mode-coefficient now becomes *almost* insignificant (but only almost) as you can see, and that is about it:

<img href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maggomor/maggomor.github.io/gh-pages/docs/assets/images/Robust_OLS_Coefficients.png">

But as discussed above, this is easily explained by Paulie just writing more major-key-songs than John "Cry, Baby, Cry" Lennon and the others. We don't need to assume that Paul died to explain that; the simple explanation that a traumatized Lennon fell into Heroin and despair and George was always melancholic and nobody ever let Ringo write a song is enough to let golly Gramps McCartney write differentially more major-key songs than the rest post-Revolver. 

So that's it! In a nutshell, nothing in the song-data corroborates the idea that Paul McCartney died on November 9th, 1966, in a car-accident. His evolution over time is rather similar to that of the other Beatles, and we find no real significant differences in our DiD-framework.
Is that, then, the last word on it? Naturally, no. In the introduction, I mentioned that this project labours under the hypothesis that any McCartney-impersonator would never be able to copy his style uniquely. But what if he would be able to? Then we would see a perfect impersonator evolve exactly as detailed here. And even worse: if it really was the Godfather of Critical Theory, Theodor W. Adorno himself, who invented all the music by the Beatles, then nothing would change at all! So clearly, our data is consistent with both the theory that Paul McCartney is still alive - and with the theory that Theodor W. Adorno wrote all Beatles-music. So a final word must wait, which means I get to do more suspicious data analysis in the future...

If you have made it down to here, you have my respect and my thanks for indulging my not-too-serious data-analysis project. I hope you enjoyed it, and perhaps even learned a bit.
