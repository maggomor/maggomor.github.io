Have you ever heard of the conspiracy theory that Paul McCartney, legendary bassist and composer of The Beatles, had died in a car accident in November 1966 shortly before the recordings for their acclaimed Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album and was replaced by a doppelg√§nger?
Today it might seem ridiculous but there was a point in the 1960s where this became a semi-fanatic cult that tried to find any and all clues they could find. Two prominent examples could be found on the Abbey Road cover. You know the one where we see the Fab Four walk across a street? McCartney is seemingly barefoot (actually not), which is interpreted as him being dead and buried, as the Beatles seemingly just exit a cemetery. If you think this is really silly proof, everything else that is given as "evidence" for this theory is even sillier. Which is no doubt why it got traction in the first place.
Recently, I was reminded of this silly theory again and I got the idea of trying to work with data as best I could to see if we could make any statements about this theory from a data-driven perspective. For this, I used the SpotifyR-library in R to access spotify-internal song-characteristics such as "dancyness", "valence", "instrumentalness", and others. You can see here, for example, how dancy the different Beatles-albums were:

I then employed a Difference-in-Difference-approach to see what the data says on this hypothesis. The idea behind this is this: if the Paul-is-Dead-hypothesis is true, it seems likely that an impersonator would not be able to rip off Macca 100% true to the original, so we would observe a significant change in songwriting. But given that this was the mid-60s where we saw an evolution in songwriting *everywhere*, we must somehow control for this. Hence the idea of comparing the change in Paul's songwriting to the change in songwriting by other Beatles. If the Paul-is-Dead-hypothesis has some merit, then we should reasonably observe Paul McCartney's songwriting evolve in a different manner as that of other Beatles.
The results to this you can find at length in my <a href="https://maggomor.github.io/data-and-the-beatles/">Data and The Beatles</a> section, but long story short: there is pretty much no effect on any of the songwriting-characteristics that Spotify keeps in their internal system. Paul's songwriting did not evolve in a systematically different fashion compared to the other Beatles (except perhaps for writing differentially more often major-key-songs, but perhaps that is just driven by Lennon becoming all mopey). And hence, there is no evidence in the data that Paul McCartney really did die in November 1966, and I am naturally fully convinced that this will put the matter entirely to rest. Visually, in the next picture you can see how pretty much none (except for "mode") of the Diff-in-Diff-coefficients are statistically significant with any of the variables on the x-axis as a dependent variable:
