Welcome to my page. I am an economist and aspiring data scientist currently pursuing a PhD in economics, located in Bayreuth, Germany.

At the heart of human understanding has always been story-telling. Be it myths shared around the campfire millenials ago, the era of modern-day television and cinema, or a computer-encoded dataset containing observations and categories. Only if we learn to view data through the prism of storytelling do we enable ourselves to understand it. And hence, everything around us can become data if only we learn to encode - or decode - it correctly.

I stand with one foot each in the philosophy and in the empirical implementation of causal analysis. With one foot each in the mathematical theory underlying random processes and in the code to implement illuminating analyses. With one foot in understanding and one foot in prediction. Prediction sans causality becomes uninformative and fragile. Understanding without predictiveness becomes stale. Only two sides make a coin.

On this website, I intend to share both professional and personal activities. Life, to me, consists of learning and creating. I love learning languages, learning instruments, learning new mathematical techniques and methodologies. Hence, on my website you will find pages that fit one - or more - of these descriptions.
